This repository contains comprehensive implementations and explanations for key data structures and algorithms, tailored for internal exams and foundational computer science knowledge. The content is divided into two main units. Unit 1 focuses on linked lists, covering various types including singly, doubly, and circular singly linked lists. It includes detailed operations such as insertion and deletion at the start, end, and middle, along with traversal and display methods. Additionally, it features a Polynomial ADT implementation for polynomial representation and addition. Unit 5 addresses searching and sorting algorithms, providing both iterative and recursive solutions for linear and binary search, as well as implementations for bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, radix sort, and shell sort. Each algorithm and data structure is presented with clear, efficient code and explanations, designed to enhance understanding through practical examples and experiments.
